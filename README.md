## DATS6101 Intro to Data Science Project 1

**The George Washington University**

### Project Description

In the diverse landscape of the United States, we've noticed that many of our friends and family members face challenges accessing groceries, regardless of whether they live in remote rural areas or urban centers. This inspired us to delve into the concept of "Food Deserts," which often go unnoticed but have a significant impact on communities.

According to the USDA, a food desert is defined as "living more than one mile from a supermarket in urban or suburban areas and more than 10 miles from a supermarket in rural areas." Recently, we've observed an increase in the prevalence of food deserts, and we suspect that the COVID-19 pandemic may be a contributing factor.

Our project aims to provide a deeper understanding of food deserts and develop strategies to address this issue. We will employ Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and decision trees to analyze and forecast the prevalence and features of food deserts. Additionally, we will explore how variables such as age, race, income, poverty rate, and vehicle accessibility influence the status of food deserts. Our overarching goal is to contribute to the eradication of hunger across the United States.

### Data Source

We have gathered our data from the [Food Access Research Atlas](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/), which provides valuable insights into food access and food deserts in the United States.

Thank you for joining us on this journey to tackle the issue of food deserts in the USA.
